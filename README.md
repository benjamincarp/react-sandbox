# react-sandbox
A very simple front end with React to play around in.

## Setup
```npm install``` 

## Running
```npm start``` 
This will compile the jsx with webpack and some babel plugins and start the react hot loader
The app will then be running on localhost:8080 and it will automatically refresh as you make changes
